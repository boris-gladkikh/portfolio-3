        <p>
          My goal as a software engineer is to write code that is scalable,
          performant, thoughtful and easy to read. I take pleasure from finding
          optimized solutions to challenges, and from seeing applications
          through the entire product lifecycle, from conception to deployment. I
          feel comfortable working with client side front end code, as well as
          back end applications, databases and APIâ€™s.

        <p>
          I am currently working as a full stack engineer with Health Data
          Movers. I was previously freelancing as a web developer - You can see
          some past projects <NavLink to="/portfolio">here</NavLink>. Prior to
          that I completed an internship with event monetization start-up
          Livestack. I am always looking to expand my knowledge of development
          and engineering and I strive to learn new things every day.
