            I specialize in full stack development with an emphasis on front end design and optimization.

            My goal as a software engineer is to develop bold, elegant front end design, and a pleasant and
            intuitive user experience. I take pleasure from finding unique solutions to challenges, and from
            seeing successful applications launched, deployed, and maintained. I strive to write code that is
            easy to read, performant, thoughtful and scalable. I feel comfortable working with client side
            front end code, as well as back end applications, databases and APIâ€™s.<br /><br /> I have worked on
            several freelance projects, including sites for electronic artists Gladkill and Satellite Respond.
            I also held a software engineer intern position with Livestack.io. I am now seeking the next
            step in my development journey and I am actively pursuing employment opportunities.

            I spend my time playing piano, writing and recording music, cooking and loving food
            of all kinds, riding my skateboard, hiking and spending time in nature, reading sci-fi, futurism 
            and horror, playing games (videogames, tabletop, and board games), watching cinema and
            shows (let's talk about Watchmen!) and hanging out with my cat & dog.
